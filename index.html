        <h1>Hello, I'm Ian</h1>
        <p>I am a student in the masters degree program for health informatics at Wake Forest University. I have had many years experience as a front and web engineer, and in the past, I've been a psychiatric technician.</p>
        <p> I decided that I wanted to do some thing that would make a real difference in the world, something to do with my first love, which was healthcare.</p>        
        <p>My health informatics and data analytics interests include, especially, improving the user experience and interfaces for healthcare applications, making it easier for patients and clinicians to do what they need to.</p>
