        <h1>Hello, I'm Ian</h1>
        <p>How can I help?</p>
        <p>
          I am a student in the masters degree program in Health Informatics at
          Wake Forest University, graduating January 2026. I have had many years
          experience as a front and web engineer, and in the past, I've been a
          psychiatric technician and CNA.
        </p>
        <p>
          After many years working only in tech, I decided I wanted to do
          something that would make a real difference in the world, something to
          do with my first love, which was the medical world.
        </p>
        <p>
          My Health Informatics and data analytics interests include,
          especially, improving the user experience and interfaces for
          healthcare applications, making it easier for patients and clinicians
          to do what they need to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also fascinated by data visualization, interoperability, and
          databases.
        </p>

        <h1>Skills</h1>

          <li>D3.js</li>
          <li>
            Many, many front-end technologies and frameworks, including React,
            Vue.js and many more.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I'm a team player, enjoy a collaborative environment, I'm flexible,
          communicative, easy to get along with, a lifelong learner.
        </p>
